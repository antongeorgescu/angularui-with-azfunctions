# Angular SPA with MSAL and Azure Functions

The code for Azure Active Directory authentication has followed the instructions given under [Sign in users and call the Microsoft Graph API from an Angular single-page application (SPA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/tutorial-v2-angular)

Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) enables developers to acquire tokens from the Microsoft identity platform endpoint in order to access secured Web APIs. These Web APIs can be the Microsoft Graph, other Microsoft APIS, third-party Web APIs, or your own Web API. MSAL is available for .NET, JavaScript, Android, and iOS, which support many different application architectures and platforms. More details can be found under [Overview of Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview)
